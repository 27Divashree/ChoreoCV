# ChoreoCV

ChoreoCV is a project that allows you to compare your dance moves with a benchmark video run using **Streamlit**. Whether you want to upload a pre-recorded video or use your webcam to score yourself live, ChoreoCV provides a fun and interactive way to evaluate your dancing skills. 
ChoreoCV also allows you to create your own dance moves using the createmoves.py script. You can save the generated dance moves as a video and compare them with other dance moves as well.
Additionally, you can have your dancing stick figure displayed on a virtual background, adding an element of entertainment to the experience.
